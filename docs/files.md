# Files, archives, search and the window

Reference for the file panes and everything around them. The [getting-started guide](getting-started.md) introduces the window and everyday tasks.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+F2 | Bulk rename the selection (pattern, find/replace, case; Undo bulk rename in the palette) |
| Ctrl+, | Settings |
| Ctrl+Shift+T | Tag picker (library) |
| Ctrl+D | Toggle favorite (library) |
| Ctrl+Shift+O | Open with… (pick an app for the selected files) |
| Ctrl+Shift+Z | Show or hide the drop zone |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Stash the selection in the drop zone |
| Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K | Global hotkey: bring Keel to the front (configurable) |

The full list, with your bindings, is in the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). Cmd replaces Ctrl on macOS.

## Columns view and drop zone

Switch a pane to **Columns** from the view buttons in the pane header. Column 0 is the tab's folder; selecting a folder lists it in the next column, and selecting a file shows its preview in the last one. Left/Right move between columns, Enter opens a folder, Up or Backspace step back one column, and the column dividers can be dragged (widths are saved). All file actions work on the column you are in.

The **drop zone** is a strip above the status bar (Ctrl+Shift+Z shows or hides it; it also appears while you drag rows). Drop rows on it, or press Ctrl+Shift+S to stash the selection, then navigate anywhere and use **Paste here** (copy) or **Move here** into the active pane's folder; **Clear** empties it. Items that no longer exist are greyed and skipped, and moved items leave the strip only once they have really moved. The stash is saved with the session. "Reduce motion" in Settings → General turns off the animations.

## Archives

Press Enter or double-click a `.zip`, `.jar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`, `.tar.zst` or `.rar` file to open it as a folder (an archive inside an archive opens too). Up leaves the archive; preview works on the files inside. Right-click for **Extract here**, **Extract to folder**, **Extract to…**, **Add to "name.zip"** and **Compress to zip…** (pick Zip, 7z, Tar or Tar.gz in the dialog; the last choice is kept as `default_format` under `[archive]` in `config.toml`). Select an existing zip, 7z, tar or tar.gz together with other items from the same folder, or drop files on the archive row, to get **Add to "name"…** (asks first, runs as a cancellable job). Extraction asks before overwriting and refuses entries that would land outside the target folder. It also works into folders on SFTP hosts and cloud accounts: paste or drag entries there, extract an archive that lives there with Extract here or Extract to folder, or open the target folder in the other pane and pick **Extract to the other pane**. Each entry is streamed from the archive to the host and renamed into place once complete.

Inside a `.zip` or `.jar` on this computer you can work as in a folder: Delete, Rename (F2), Cut, Copy and Paste, drag and drop, New folder and New file, and paste or drop files and folders from anywhere (local, SFTP, cloud, another archive) into it. Each operation rewrites the archive once: the new archive is written beside the old one, synced and renamed over it, so a cancel, an error or a crash leaves the original as it was. Entries that stay are copied byte for byte (stored entries stay stored, password-protected entries are never decrypted, zip64 archives stay zip64); new files are deflated. Deleted entries go for good, and their folder stays. Large archives take as long as copying them once.

Everything else is read-only: 7z, tar and RAR archives, an archive inside an archive and an archive on an SFTP host or a cloud account (copy it to this computer first). You can extract from any of them and add files and folders to a zip, 7z, tar or tar.gz with Add to (entries of the same name are replaced; a 7z is re-encoded, a tar is streamed, and the old archive stays untouched until the new one is complete). RAR is read through libunrar and never written. Moving entries out of an archive is not supported: copy them, then delete. Password-protected entries are marked with a lock and cannot be previewed.

## Recycle Bin and Trash

Open **Recycle Bin** (Windows) or **Trash** (macOS; Linux, any freedesktop-compliant desktop) in the sidebar. Columns: Name, Original location, Size, Deleted on. **Restore** moves the selected items back to their original folders; if something with the same name is already there Keel stops and says so instead of overwriting it. **Delete permanently** and **Empty Recycle Bin** remove items for good and ask first (Empty shows the item count). The folder is read-only otherwise: nothing can be pasted, created or renamed in it, and a trashed folder cannot be browsed until it is restored. The preview panel shows trashed files where the system keeps them at a normal path (Windows `$R` files, Linux `files/`, every item on macOS); otherwise it says there is no preview.

**macOS.** The Trash entry lists your Trash folder (`~/.Trash`) and the Trash folder of each mounted volume (`/Volumes/<name>/.Trashes/<your user id>`) as plain folders, so Size and Deleted on (the time the item was moved there) are shown but Original location stays empty: macOS keeps Finder's "Put Back" location where other apps cannot read it reliably. **Restore to…** asks for a folder and moves the selected items into it; it stops before moving anything when a name is already there or two items share a name, and an item on another volume than the folder you pick is refused (pick a folder on that volume, or copy it out). **Delete permanently** and **Empty Trash** remove the items for good after the same confirmations. macOS lets an app read the Trash only with Full Disk Access: without it the Trash tab says so (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access).

## Terminal

A terminal pane sits under the file panes. It starts in the active pane's folder and, with "Follow pane" on, changes directory when you navigate. Shells: PowerShell, Windows PowerShell, cmd and each installed WSL distribution on Windows; `$SHELL`, zsh or bash on macOS; `$SHELL`, bash or sh on Linux.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ``Ctrl+` `` (backtick; Cmd on macOS) | Open, focus or hide the terminal. Hiding keeps the shell running; the x button ends it |
| `F6` or `Shift+Esc` | Leave the terminal and return to the file panes |
| `Esc` | Goes to the shell (vim, less, fzf) |
| Context menu, "Open terminal here" | Focus the terminal in the current folder |

"Follow pane" sends a `cd` only when the shell looks idle at a plain prompt; heavily customised prompts (oh-my-posh and similar) can prevent it.

## Search without Everything

On Windows, when Everything is not running, Keel uses its own index: it reads the NTFS file table and keeps it current from the USN journal, and stores it in the cache folder. Queries are substring, glob (`*.pdf`) or `regex:`, with `folder:` and `in:<path>` filters.

Reading the whole file table needs administrator rights. Until you grant them Keel indexes your home folder (recursively) plus one level of each drive's root. Settings → General → **Index all drives (administrator)** asks Windows for elevation once, runs a helper (`keel --index-service`) that builds the full index, and hands the files back to your user; later starts need no elevation. The status bar names the active backend and shows its state. If Everything is running it is used instead and the button is greyed out.

On macOS and Linux Keel uses Spotlight (`mdfind`) or `plocate`/`locate` when they answer. Otherwise (and on Windows when nothing else works) it keeps its own **name index** of your home folder: a walk that skips hidden and git-ignored entries, saved in the cache folder (`<cache>/index/walk-<hash>.db`) so the next start is instant, and kept current from file system events in half-second batches. It is rebuilt when it is older than 7 days. The status bar says "indexing N files…" while it builds; searches work as soon as the first build finishes. Queries use the same syntax as above (substring, `*.pdf`, `regex:`, `folder:`, `in:<path>`).

## Command line

```
keel [FOLDER] [--new-window] [--profile NAME] [--search QUERY]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `FOLDER` | Open this folder (a file opens its folder with the file selected). Relative paths are resolved against where you ran `keel` |
| `--new-window` | Start a separate window even if Keel is already running |
| `--profile NAME` | Use the profile `NAME` ([Profiles](#profiles)) |
| `--search QUERY` | Open a search tab with this query (in FOLDER when given) |
| `--version`, `--help` | Print and exit |

By default there is one Keel per user and profile: a second `keel` hands its folder or search to the running window over a private pipe or socket that only your user can reach, brings it forward and exits. Turn this off with "Reuse the running window" in Settings → General. Settings → General also has the **global hotkey** (default Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K, empty to disable) that brings Keel forward from any app; it needs Ctrl, Alt or the Windows/Command key besides Shift, and Ctrl+Alt alone is avoided because it is AltGr on many layouts.

## Profiles

A profile is a separate settings file and session (tabs, views, drop zone). Settings → Profiles creates one (a copy of the current settings), renames, deletes (to the OS trash) and switches; the command palette has "Switch profile: <name>". `keel --profile <name>` starts in a profile. Files: `<config>/profiles/<name>/config.toml`; the session is in the cache folder (`profiles/<name>/session.json`, or `session.json` for `default`).

## Icon themes

Settings → Icons lists the built-in icons and any installed theme, previews them and switches at runtime. To install one, type the extension id from the Visual Studio Marketplace (`publisher.name`, for example `PKief.material-icon-theme`) and press **Install from VS Code Marketplace…**. Keel downloads the package, shows its license and installs only after you press **I accept**. Themes are unpacked into your own config folder; Keel does not bundle or redistribute them.

Only SVG and PNG icons are used. An SVG that references anything outside itself (an `<image>`, `<script>` or `<foreignObject>`, an external `href` or `url()`, CSS `@import`, entities) is refused, both at install time and when the theme loads, and the number skipped is reported. This stops a theme from making Keel read local files or network shares. A theme holds at most 10,000 icons and 64 MB.
